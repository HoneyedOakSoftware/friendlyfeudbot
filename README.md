# FriendlyFeudBot  
  
**Friendly feud bot** is a bot for Discord thought up by  [Wouter Dekens](https://github.com/WouterDekens%5D).
The idea of the bot is to function as a scorekeeper across challenges issue between people. An independent arbiter can be appointed to decide who won, should there be a dispute between the participants.

# Status of the project

The project is in Alpha state and in no way "ready  for production", Lots of features are still missing and functionality can be shifted around drastically.
